## Bridging the Communication Gap with Indian Sign Language  

SignWays is an initiative aimed at promoting awareness and accessibility for Indian Sign Language (ISL). The project leverages artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing to facilitate real-time translation between ISL gestures, text, and speech.  

## Features  
- **ISL Translation**: Converts Indian Sign Language to Text and Speech.  
- **AI-Powered Recognition**: Uses deep learning models to enhance translation accuracy.  
- **Real-Time Processing**: Enables seamless communication between hearing and hearing-impaired individuals.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use across different environments, including education, workplaces, and public spaces.  

## Why SignWays?  
Despite being an essential mode of communication for the deaf community, Indian Sign Language remains underrepresented in technology. SignWays seeks to bridge this gap by offering an accessible, AI-driven solution that empowers individuals and promotes inclusivity.
